### Hover Domain Config

Two DNS A records
A  *  104.198.14.52
A  @  104.198.14.52

That IP is the Netlify load balancer.

https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/


* Find your DNS provider's DNS record settings for your apex domain, such as petsofnetlify.com.
* Add an A record. Depending on your provider, leave the host field empty or enter @.
* Point the record to Netlify's load balancer IP address: 104.198.14.52.
* Save your settings. It may take a full day for the settings to propagate across the global Domain Name System.
